                    <div id="edp">G.A.I.A (Guided AI for Innovation in Agriculture) helps you detect plant health issues early, giving you the upper hand in preventing long-term damage. Powered by a sophisticated Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model from Hugging Face, G.A.I.A analyzes images of your plants to identify subtle signs of disease, pests, or nutrient imbalances before they become visible to the naked eye. Early intervention is key to saving plants and reducing the need for harsh treatments. G.A.I.A's user-friendly platform is perfect for both hobbyist gardeners and commercial growers, providing real-time insights and recommendations. By using G.A.I.A, you can ensure your plants stay healthy, thriving, and protected from the start.</div>

                        <div id="spp">By analyzing local weather patterns such as humidity, temperature, and rainfall, G.A.I.A predicts potential plant health risks in your area, allowing you to take preventive measures before problems arise. Weather conditions play a crucial role in the development of plant diseases, pests, and fungal infections. G.A.I.A uses real-time weather data to model how specific environmental factors can increase the likelihood of issues like mold, mildew, or insect outbreaks. This proactive approach helps you prepare in advance, adjusting care routines like watering schedules, pest control, or soil treatments to minimize risks. With weather-based predictions, G.A.I.A offers personalized advice tailored to your region’s climate, ensuring that you’re always one step ahead in protecting your plants. By leveraging the power of localized weather information, G.A.I.A empowers you to make more informed decisions, keeping your plants healthier and more resilient in the face of changing environmental conditions.</div>
